<title>RE: About the "Do not copy even if it's yours" rule and why
       it should be edited.</title>
<p>I voted for abolishing the rule, because currently it's silly. It's
fine to copy, as long you use [nopoints]... wait, it has changed? Why?
The points aren't the requirement to get VPS anymore, and number of
characters in posts doesn't matter as much as posts. I've lots of points
because of long informative posts, but the score calculation is biased
towards posts. And nopoints makes uglier posts in my humble opinion.

<p>Besides. most of posts I saw on this forum aren't too high of
quality. Just nonsense like thanks, and stuff like this. Seriously,
do you think that "thank you" posts are better than copying and
pasting your own content.

<p>Also, yes, I broke the rules by copying my own website. Not that I
care.
