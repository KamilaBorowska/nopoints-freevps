<title>RE: About the "Do not copy even if it's yours" rule and why
       it should be edited.</title>
<p>I voted for abolishing the rule, because currently it's silly. It's
fine to copy, as long you use [nopoints]. The points aren't the
requirement to get VPS anymore, and number of characters in posts
doesn't matter as much as posts. I've lots of points because of long
informative posts, but the score calculation is biased towards posts.
And nopoints makes uglier posts in my humble opinion.
